# hello-world
jhnfanning's first github repository

technology writer with a long history of loving CASE, RAD, event-driven 4GLs, autocoder, component-based development,
Martin-McClure action diagram based code generation, portfolio assembly of business objects coordinated into workflows
stored in XML repositories, Cold Fusion, Ruby on Rails, node.js, Angular.js etc. In other words basically anything that
makes the developers life easier and more automated and leverages the Adam Smith comparative advantages, skills and
cognitive styles of both lower level of abstraction software engineers and higher abstraction application developers.
